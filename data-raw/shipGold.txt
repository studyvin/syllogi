Captain Buck Tooth has taken you prisoner aboard his pirate ship, the Lucky Lemon. 
He sees from your college transcripts you have taken a couple of statistics courses. 
Captain Buck Tooth wants you to predict the amount of gold a ship is carrying based on the size of the ship. 
Specifically, he thinks bigger ships carry more gold. 
For the last several ships he has looted he measured the height in inches when the ship was still way off on the horizon. 
The captain also has a good memory and remembers how much gold was taken from each ship in number of pieces. 
Captain Buck Tooth wants you to come up with a research question and test your question. 
Captain Buck Tooth's favorite $\alpha$ level is $0.05$. 
The captain hates all of the crazy statistical words that statisticians use. 
If you do not present your answers in the context of ships and gold you will be fired. From a canon. Into the sun.
