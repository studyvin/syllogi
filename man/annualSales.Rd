\details{
You are hired as a statistical consultant.
Twelve stores in the Fort Collins, CO area have asked you to develop a prediction model for their annual gross sales (sales; measured in $1000 of dollars).
They would like to know if it is possible to predict the amount of their sales
by knowing how much they spend annually on advertising
(advert; measured in $1000 of dollars)
and the quality of their storeâ€™s typical product
(quality; measure on a scale from 0 = very poor quality to 25 = exceptional quality).
