\details{
A study on kernels of wheat was done.
There are two classes of wheat: hard and soft red winter wheat.
Each kernel measured for density, hardness, size, weight, and moisture content.
Each kernel was classified by visual inspection if healthy, sprouted, or scab.
A row in the data frame represents a kernel of wheat.
