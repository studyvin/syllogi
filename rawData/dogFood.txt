You are hired as a statistical consultant for a dog food manufacturing
company. The engineers who designed the company's dog food would like
to know how it compares to the current top selling dog food brands on
the market? To answer this question, 25 puppies of the same breed and
age (within a week of each other) were chosen for this study. Five
puppies were assigned to each dog food type. After 4 weeks the percent
of weight gained for each puppy was determined. The enumeration is in the
dogFood.RDS file. The variable \gain is the percent
weight gain.

Dog food types:
1 = Other: top seller 
2 = Our dog food 
3 = Other: second best seller 
4 = Other: third best seller 
5 = Other: fourth best seller
