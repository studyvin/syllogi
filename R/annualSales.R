#' Twelve stores in the Fort Collins, CO area have asked you to develop a prediction model for their annual gross sales (sales; measured in $1000 of dollars).

#' by knowing how much they spend annually on advertising
#' (advert; measured in $1000 of dollars)
#' and the quality of their storeâ€™s typical product
#' (quality; measure on a scale from 0 = very poor quality to 25 = exceptional quality).
